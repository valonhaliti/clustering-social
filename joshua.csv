If you make the mistake of doing that with fury he will make you tired. You know Fury can move fast you will have to be selective with your shots. Until you work on delivering that power for longer. You need to work on your foot work. Build upon your weakness will keep you undefeated. Amazing how far you have come and you are a role model for others.  Furys footwork is fast.

Having put Wlad down, I was shocked to see you were too gassed to do finish him off. All that extra muscle just leaves them crying out for more oxygen ... Your sharpness wasn't nearly as good as I've seen it when you weighed less.  Get back to that weight and keep it there.  Last thing, I like your humbleness about the fact that you're still learning... However, you must learn some decent head movement as a priority. You are too upright and static at times - that is why you got caught with Wlad's right straight down the pipe in the 6th -  Wlad had been trying that right cutely at the start of every round from the 3rd onwards.
